# Mars_Communication_Simulation
Contains MATLAB code that simulates a communications system that transmits images from Mars to Earth, accounting for cosmic background radiation.

The MATLAB livescript file Mars_Communication_Simulation.mlx contains code and explanations for a simulated communications system. The communications system encodes image data into a specially-designed transmission signal with error correction. The signal is sent through a noisy channel, simulating the effects of cosmic background radiation. The receiver receives and interprets the transmitted data, using error correction to improve image quality.
